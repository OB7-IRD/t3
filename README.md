## Overview

The new version of Tropical Tuna Treatment (T3) process is developed in
R language and available through a package. One of the advantages of
this language is that it is more understandable and manipulated by the
fisheriesâ€™ scientific community rather than Java language. Moreover,
this development follows the principles of the open and reproducible
science:

  - Process transparency: the code is fully documented and the
    [documentation](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3) of how works the
    program will be available.
  - Open access and Open source: the code source is hosted on a github
    repository [t3](https://github.com/OB7-IRD/t3/) under a GPL version
    3 license. In the end, it would be available on the Comprehensive R
    Archive Network (CRAN).
  - Referencing of the software : enable result reproducibility and
    versioning (Depetris et al., 2020) : version 0.9.0 -
    [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3878125](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/210599699).
