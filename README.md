***Tropical Tuna Treatment***

## Warning

Package and documentation still in construction ! We need few more time
to reach 88 miles per hours, be patient.

## Overview

The new version of Tropical Tuna Treatment (T3) process is developed in
R language and available through a package. One of the advantages of
this language is that it is more understandable and manipulated by the
fisheriesâ€™ scientific community rather than Java language. Moreover,
this development follows the principles of the open and reproducible
science:

- Process transparency: the code is fully documented and the
  [documentation](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3) of how works the program
  will be available.
- Open access and Open source: the code source is hosted on a github
  repository [t3](https://github.com/OB7-IRD/t3/) under a GPL version 3
  license. In the end, it would be available on the Comprehensive R
  Archive Network (CRAN).
- Referencing of the software enable result reproducibility and
  versioning: version 2.0.1 [DOI:
  10.5281/zenodo.14947393](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/210599699).
