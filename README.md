***Tropical Tuna Treatment***

## Warning

Package and documentation still in construction ! We need few more time
to reach 88 miles per hours, be patient.

## Overview

The new version of Tropical Tuna Treatment (T3) process is developed in
R language and available through a package. One of the advantages of
this language is that it is more understandable and manipulated by the
fisheries’ scientific community rather than Java language. Moreover,
this development follows the principles of the open and reproducible
science:

- Process transparency: the code is fully documented and the
  [documentation](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3) of how works the program
  will be available.
- Open access and Open source: the code source is hosted on a github
  repository [t3](https://github.com/OB7-IRD/t3/) under a GPL version 3
  license. In the end, it would be available on the Comprehensive R
  Archive Network (CRAN).
- Referencing of the software enable result reproducibility and
  versioning: [DOI:
  10.5281/zenodo.14947393](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/210599699).
