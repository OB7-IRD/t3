***Tropical Tuna Treatment***

## Warning
Package and documentation still in construction ! We need few more time to reach 88 miles per hours, be patient.

## Overview

The new version of Tropical Tuna Treatment (T3) process is developed in R language and available through a package. One of the advantages of this language is that it is more understandable and manipulated by the fisheriesâ€™ scientific community rather than Java language. Moreover, this development follows the principles of the open and reproducible science:

* Process transparency: the code is fully documented and the [documentation](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3) of how works the program will be available.
* Open access and Open source: the code source is hosted on a github repository [t3](https://github.com/OB7-IRD/t3/) under a GPL version 3 license. In the end, it would be available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
* Referencing of the software : enable result reproducibility and versioning (Depetris et al., 2020) : version 0.9.0 - [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3878125](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/210599699).
