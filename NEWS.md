# t3 3.0.0 - 2025-04-15

## Changed
* Level 1 optimization gather methods 1.1 and 1.2 for [raising factors computation](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/articles/level_2.html#process-1-1-https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/articles/level_1.html#process-1-1-raising-factors-level-1)
* Fix typo (weight instead of weigth) in :
  - R6 reference object class [well](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/reference/well.html),
  - R6 reference object class [standardisedsampleset](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/reference/standardisedsampleset.html), 
  - process 1.3 [conversion_weight_categories](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/articles/level_1.html#process-1-3-logbook-weight-categories-conversion),
  - process 2.4 [well_set_weight_categories()](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/articles/level_2.html#process-2-4-well-set-weight-categories).
**Warning: you will need to correct this typo in your scripts**

## Added
* Add method [fishing_effort()](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/articles/level_1.html#process-1-4-fishing-effort-indicators-calculation) gathering methods 1.5 to 1.8:
- set_duration : calculated according to a linear function of catch weight with two parameters a and b. These are found through a reference table (set_duration_ref.csv), for each year, ocean, fishing school and country. 
- time_at_sea : the process divides the day's time at sea declared between the activities, allowing the allocation of time at sea, recorded on that date. If no activity to allocate time at sea is recorded on a given date, with a non-zero time at sea, a transit activity is created (whose id_activity contains #666#) to allocate the time ate sea of that date.
- fishing_time : the process module the duration of a working day according to the real sunrise and sunset of each day. It then divides the day's fishing time between the fishing activities recorded on that date. If no fishing activity is recorded on a given date with a non-zero fishing time, a searching activity is created (whose id_activity contains #666#) to allocate the fishing time of that date.
 - searching_time = fishing_time - set_duration.
 
## Removed 
* Methods 1.5 to 1.8 and 1.2 (rf2). 

**Warning: you will need to correct this typo in your scripts**

* Manage  fishing effort calculation for activities with multiple floating objects or object operation code declared.

# t3 2.1.0 - 2025-03-19

## Added
* Add a `catch_count` column in elementarycatches data, recording the number of individuals caught in a set, which can be recorded in place of `catch_weight` for by-catch species, in the new version of observe database.  
* Add method ([`object_model_data$activitycoderefs_data()`](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/reference/object_model_data.html#method-object_model_data-activitycoderefs_data)) to import activity code referential for time allocation (time_allocation_activity_code_ref.csv).
* Add argument `species_fate_codes` in method [`object_model_data$activities_object_creation()`](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/reference/object_model_data.html#method-object_model_data-activities_object_creation) to import activities and elementarycatch(es) with the same function. 
* Add argument `activity_code_ref` in [level_1](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/articles/level_1.html), process 1.5 [`set_duration()`](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/reference/full_trips.html#method-full_trips-set_duration-), 1.6 [`time_at_sea()`](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/reference/full_trips.html#method-time-at-sea-) and 1.7 [`fishing_time()`](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/reference/full_trips.html#method-fishing-time-).

## Changed
* Optimization : 
  - Change elementary catch(es) type from R6 Object to data.frame included into activity R6 Object.
  - Gather function to create ([`object_model_data()`](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/reference/object_model_data.html)) and add ([`full_trips$add_elementarycatches()`](https://ob7-ird.github.io/t3/reference/full_trips.html)) activities and elementary catches.
* Update the activity code referential for time allocation (time_allocation_activity_code_ref.csv)
* Improve fishing effort evaluation. The duration of activities is now calculated according to the activity code referential, in order to allocate time only to significant activities:
 - set_duration : calculated according to a linear function of catch weight with two parameters a and b. These are found through a reference table (set_duration_ref.csv), for each year, ocean, fishing school and country. 
 - time_at_sea : the process divides the day's time at sea declared between the activities, allowing the allocation of time at sea, recorded on that date. If no activity to allocate time at sea is recorded on a given date, with a non-zero time at sea, a transit activity is created (whose id_activity contains #666#) to allocate the time ate sea of that date.
 - fishing_time : the process module the duration of a working day according to the real sunrise and sunset of each day. It then divides the day's fishing time between the fishing activities recorded on that date. If no fishing activity is recorded on a given date with a non-zero fishing time, a searching activity is created (whose id_activity contains #666#) to allocate the fishing time of that date.
 - searching_time = fishing_time - set_duration.
* Manage  fishing effort calculation for activities with multiple floating objects or object operation code declared.

* Classification of unknown school type (no data available) by clustering according to major tuna species composition.      
* Development of a statistical model accounting for:
    - Spatial and temporal structure of the fishery (location and date of the catch)
    - Vessel specificity which impacts the species composition of the catch
    - Crew reporting information which enables more flexibility in the model when a marginal composition is caught
    - Several years of fishing in the training to increase the robustness of the estimates
* Model checking to ensure reliability of the results
